                    <h2>30 June. 1894, Londonâ€™s Tower Bridge is Opened</h2>
                    <p>Tower Bridge in London was officially opened by H.R.H. The Prince of Wales. 
                    After the ceremony the bascules were raised to allow a flotilla of ships and boats 
                    to sail down the Thames.</p>
                    <p>Tower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London built between 1886 and 1894.
                    The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of 
                    London, resulting in it sometimes being confused with London Bridge, situated some 0.80 km upstream.</p>
